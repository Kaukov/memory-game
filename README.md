Memory Game
===========

This is my take on a Memory Game project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.  
The game's logic can be found in `assets/js/main.js`. The whole game is written in HTML, CSS and JS.  
Enjoy!

How To Play
===========
The game requires you to match tiles, 2 by 2, with matching icons on them. You win when you match all present tiles.  
Depending on how fast you complete the game, your score is calculated and displayed on the victory screen.  
If you don't feel like playing, or you want to start over, you can always reset the game with the reset button below the game title.

What to expect from the game
============================
You can expect a fun little game that can be completed in short time - useful for short breaks or a few minutes to get distracted from life/work.  
The game randomly shuffles (currently fixed size) 16 tiles with 8 different icons which are randomly selected each time the game is [re-]started.

Game dependencies
=================
No dependencies are required to play. All assets are locally available removing the need for an active internet connection.

Contributing
=====================

You can contribute by opening an issue on a problem/bug you found, or opening a
pull request for me to merge something you think can be improved.  
All feedback is welcome!
